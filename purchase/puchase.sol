// This contract can be used to hold money while an item is in transit
// during purchase.
// This protocol is a variation of a protocol by Oleg Andreev which is
// described at
// https://gatecoin.com/blog/2015/10/blockchain2-disrupting-disrutors/
//
// Assume Bob wants to buy an item worth x Ether from Alice.
// Alice creates this contract and and sends 2x Ether to the contract
// together with its creation transaction.
// If Bob does not react, Alice can get her money back.
// Next, Bob sends 2x Ether to the contract.
// From now on, both Alice's and Bob's money is locked in the contract.
// Now, Alice sends the item to Bob.
// Bob receives the item, checks that it is what he expected and confirms
// this with a transaction to the contract. This causes the contract to be
// disabled and both getting their deposits plus/minus the item price back.
//
// If Bob does not receive the item or the item is not what he expected,
// he can negotiate with Alice (off-chain). The contract will keep
// their money until come to an agreement: Either Bob finally confirms
// or Alice fully refunds Bob.
// A more complex version of this contract could include an arbitrator who
// can be called if Alice and Bob cannot resolve their dispute.
